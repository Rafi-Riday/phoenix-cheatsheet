#### Website is created to provide a cheat sheet for Phoenix NSU admission students.

##### Used technologies:
- SvelteKit
- Tailwind
- DaisyUI
- Katex (Math)

##### Website contains features like:
- Website is Static Site Generated `(SSG)`.
- Even with intensive tasks, website is much faster, powered by `Svelte JS`, Responsive with `Tailwind CSS`. In this project I found that `Svelte` is really super developer-friendly. Here DX is 10 time better than React. Also its official SSR Framework `SvelteKit` is as cool as `Next JS`.
- Provided all collection of information related to NSU admission syllabus.
- No Database is used, instead used `.json` files.
- Used `Katex` library to show mathematical formula & equations.
- Used SVG format of drawings (Such as for triangles, quadrilaterals etc).
- Routes are based on subjects.
